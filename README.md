# Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)
## Elasticity Partial Differential Equations with PINN
- Extend the application of PINN to solving partial differential equations related to the elasticity of a 2D plane.
- Implementing Physics Informed Neural Network to the 2D problem. A thin plate fixed at the boundary with periodic in-plane loading in the interior. Classis case of plane stress boundary value problem of linear elasticity.
-Understand the incorporation of physical principles into neural networks for scientific problem-solving.
